                <q>I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for a free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next twelve weeks was the best-and most gruelling-time of my life. Scince completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup.</q>

                <p class="bold">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
                <q>Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the programm. The entire curriclum and staff did not disappoint.They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers . 100% recommend!</q>

                <q>The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The programm gave me the confedence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.</q>
